Pointer types in C# store the memory address of a variable, allowing direct memory access. 
They are used in high-performance or unmanaged code scenarios. Because using pointers can bypass .NETâ€™s safety checks and risk memory corruption, pointer code must be inside an unsafe block, which requires special compiler permission. 
This marks the code as potentially risky but necessary for low-level operations.

In summary, pointer types in C#:

Hold memory addresses pointing to variables (usually value types).

Are used in performance-critical or interop code needing direct memory access.

Require the unsafe keyword to compile and run due to security and stability risks.

Cannot be used with managed objects unless pinned to prevent garbage collector movement
